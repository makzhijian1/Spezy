# Spezy
Bill-Splitting App (2020 UOL FYP)
This project aim is to develop a fully functional mobile application that will allow users to accurately split a bill with minimal steps and carry out funds transfer from one user to another, all within the same application. The developed application must also be able to track the status of payments, and let users know once a bill has been completely split, or if certain participants have yet to pay for their share.
